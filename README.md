# GOIT_Web_Module1_HW

## Project name: My assistant

* We have made a Python package and a console script from the personal assistant script that can be called anywhere in the system from the console with the **my-assistant** command.
* To do this, we created a file and folder structure:

├── my_assistant 

│   ├── main.py   

│   ├── handlers.py 

│   ├── classes.py 

│   └── __init__.py   

└── setup.py   

└── README.md  



* Next, the package is installed into the system with the command ```pip install -e .```(or ```pip install .```).
* After installation, the my_assistant package appears in the system.
* When the package is installed in the system, the script can be called anywhere from the console with ```my-assistant```
